### Stepwise

Stepwise is an ongoing project, which originated from Stanford's Treehacks. 
It was built on an Angular framework, and serves more as a proof of concept.
The main idea was to build a website which could gameify challenges to make the world a better place. The challenge categories were based off of the United Nations Sustainability Goals, and as of right now, only the "Climate" section has actionable challenges.
